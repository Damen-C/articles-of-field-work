# Bridging Progress and Preservation: Balancing Biodiversity and Ecosystem Management in the Chubu Crossroad Project

The proposed northern section of the Chubu Crossroad, an expressway in Japan that would connect the Shizuoka Prefecture in the east to the Nagano Prefecture in the west, received mixed reactions from local residents regarding the detailed route plan that was recently presented by the Japanese national government on the 19th of July 2023. In this report, I will delve into the complexities of the issue, focusing on how to strike a balance between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management.

## Introduction: A Highway with Mixed Reactions
The Chubu Crossroad is a 132-kilometer highway from Shin-Shimizu in Shizuoka Prefecture to Saku-Komoro in Nagano Prefecture. Currently, the northern section spanning around 34 kilometers between Nagasaka and Yasuho has not been implemented as a part of the project [1].

The opinions of local residents are divided on the matter. Some express welcome and approval, mentioning improved convenience for transportation and tourism development, while others are strongly opposed, expressing concerns about the environmental impact and preservation of natural resources.

Some locals hold high expectations for the economic benefits that the expressway could potentially bring. With the reduction in transportation time being a key factor, there's a widespread anticipation for an enhanced efficiency in cargo movement, ultimately boosting productivity. Moreover, this time-saving aspect is also foreseen to create a surge in demand for agricultural products due to improved freshness and accessibility. Another exciting prospect is the anticipated increase in tourist numbers, drawn by the newfound ease of travel [4]. Professor Shinichi Mutoh, from the Yamanashi University's Center for Regional Disaster Management, has projected that the complete opening of the Chubu Cross Expressway could lead to an impressive economic impact, estimating a total value exceeding 600 billion yen over a 50-year period [5].  

Despite the potential economic benefits, some people expressed skepticism on the construction of the expressway. On social media, there are posts that highlight the beauty of the starry skies in the Nobeoka Highland region, saying "The starry sky in Nobeoka is so beautiful." Some local residents are concerned that light pollution from the expressway could potentially impact the area's pristine night sky. These voices emphasize the importance of preserving the natural beauty of the surrounding area and call for measures to mitigate the potential effects of the expressway on the environment [6]. 

Organizations like the "Chubu Crossroad Southern Foot of the Yatsugatake New Route Residents' Association" (CCSFYNRRA, for short) voiced their doubts and demand clear explanations from the government and the prefecture regarding the environmental impact assessment (EIA) conducted by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) in relation to the construction of the expressway. They emphasized that the on-site surveys conducted by MLIT for the EIA were flawed. For instance, it's noted that the data used for analysis includes maps from 40 years ago, which do not accurately reflect the current state of residential areas. The assessments are criticized for not accurately representing the actual land use, characteristics, and impact of the road on the environment, nature, landscape, and overall quality of life. The CCSFYNRRA demands a redo of the inadequate EIA and a revision of the road administrative procedures from MLIT [7]. 

## How the Construction of Highways May Impact the Surrounding Ecology  
Understanding the environmental impact of expressways is essential for informed decision-making regarding the implementation of such projects. In a recent study examining the impact of expressways on plant physiology and the accumulation of hazardous elements in forest ecosystems in southwest Slovakia, researchers collected soil and plant samples from forested areas situated at varying distances from the expressway—ranging from 30 to 8,100 meters. The study measured multiple parameters, including soil pH, nitrogen and carbon content, as well as levels of Cadmium (Cd) and Copper (Cu). Additionally, physiological parameters of plants such as the rate of photosynthesis and chlorophyll content were assessed. One of the most striking findings was the increase in Cd content in soils closer to the expressway. Excessive levels of Cd were also found in the O-horizons (organic layers) and even in the background zones far from the road. Cu showed a marked enrichment in surface horizons, indicating contamination due to car traffic. The study revealed that the most significant environmental variables affecting plant physiology were the content of Cd and Cu in plants and Cu in soils. Among the plant species studied, Melica uniflora was found to be most sensitive to a decrease in average chlorophyll content, which was a consequence of excessive accumulation of Cd in leaf tissues [8].

In a separate study focused on the repercussions of rapid industrialization and urbanization on the landscape and Ecosystem Service Values (ESVs) in China's Pearl River Delta, researchers utilized specialized computer software to conduct a quantitative assessment of the ecological and economic consequences of land-use changes between 1990 and 2017. The study revealed that expressways in the region have both direct and indirect impacts on surrounding ecosystems.

Directly, the expansion or upgrading of expressways can fragment ecological corridors—vital links that connect disparate habitats. Such fragmentation often leads to a decline in biodiversity. Additionally, expressway construction frequently prompts shifts in local land use, affecting ecosystem services such as water purification, air quality, and soil fertility. The study also noted that natural watercourses may be altered or even eliminated to accommodate industrial, commercial, and residential developments, thereby disrupting the inherent structure of river networks and affecting the region's ESVs.

Indirectly, the blurring of urban and rural landscapes, coupled with population growth, escalates the demand for land for various human activities. This heightened demand exerts pressure on natural ecosystems, leading to unsustainable land-use changes over time [9].  

## Balancing Biodiversity Conservation with Ecosystem Management in Expressway Construction  
While the economic advantages of expressways are undeniable, their construction poses significant challenges to ecological sustainability. Achieving a harmonious balance between economic development and environmental preservation necessitates a multi-faceted approach. This involves two key components: rigorous EIA and robust Public Awareness and Education initiatives.

#### EIA:

Before construction begins, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive EIA. This assessment should not be viewed as a mere formality but as an essential instrument for understanding the ecological intricacies of the proposed construction site. According to scientific literature cited in this report, a thorough EIA should encompass the following elements:

- **Soil Testing:** Recent studies have revealed elevated levels of Cd and Cu in areas adjacent to expressways. Soil tests should be conducted to establish baseline levels of these and other potential contaminants. This data will inform construction practices aimed at minimizing further soil degradation.
  
- **Flora and Fauna Surveys:** A meticulous examination of local biodiversity is crucial, with a focus on species that are especially vulnerable to environmental changes. For instance, research in southwest Slovakia identified *Melica uniflora* as highly sensitive to Cd levels. Knowledge of such specific sensitivities can guide the development of targeted mitigation strategies.

- **Water Quality Assessments:** Expressways often necessitate alterations to natural watercourses. Assessing water quality prior to construction can offer valuable insights into the potential impact on local water bodies and the broader watershed.

#### Public Awareness and Education:

The success of large infrastructure projects like expressways often hinges on public support, which can be significantly enhanced through informed opinion. Local governments, construction firms, and community representatives, such as CCSFYNRRA, should establish a platform for disseminating the findings of the EIA to the public. Educational materials, ideally developed in partnership with local educational institutions and environmental organizations, could elucidate the importance of biodiversity and the specific ecological risks associated with expressway construction.

## Conclusion:

The construction of expressways, while economically beneficial, presents a complex set of challenges to ecological sustainability. As evidenced by studies conducted in southwest Slovakia and China's Pearl River Delta, the ecological ramifications of such projects are both direct and indirect, affecting everything from soil and water quality to local biodiversity and broader ecosystem services.

The construction of expressways is not merely an engineering challenge but a complex interplay of economic, social, and environmental factors. By adopting a comprehensive approach that integrates rigorous environmental assessments with public education, we can pave the way for infrastructure that serves both our economic aspirations and our ecological responsibilities.
