# The Importance of Science in Environmental Preservation and Conservation: Insights from Marine Biodiversity Fieldwork

## Introduction:
During Sep. 25 to 29, 2023, I participated in a comprehensive fieldwork study on marine biodiversity at the Shimoda Marine Research Center. Working closely with a study group, we collected marine samples, which we later observed and analyzed in a laboratory setting. This academic experience presented numerous firsts for me: it was my first visit to Shimoda, Izu, my first experience aboard a research ship, and my introduction to the world of plankton through microscopic observation.  
    One of the most profound realizations during this study for me was the richness of marine biodiversity, exemplified by the amount of living plankton found in only a few droplets of seawater. This report will first provide an overview of our sample collection process, then explain our data analysis procedures, and discuss the implications concerning the pivotal role of science in environmental conservation.

## Sample Collection and Data Analysis:
Our sampling began in the outer region of the sea, where we employed various techniques tailored for different marine constituents. Utilizing the Smith-McIntyre grab, we extracted mud and sand from the seafloor to study macrofauna such as sea spiders and brittle stars. For studying microplankton, a weighted net was used. To categorize the microplankton based on size, two mesh sizes - 300 mesh and 100 mesh - were used. Additionally, the CTD device was used to record the salinity (through conductivity measurements), temperature, and depth (underwater pressure) of the ocean. Subsequently, we navigated to the inner sea region, closer to the shore, to replicate the sampling process.  
    After returning to the laboratory, our first step was to enumerate the marine organisms retrieved from the samples. This data was then tabulated, making it suitable for further statistical analyses using the R programming language. To explore if there were any significant statistical variations in both the types and abundances of marine organisms relative to their collection sites, an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted. Further, multidimensional scaling techniques were employed to cluster the data within a two-dimensional space, providing a visual representation of the patterns observed.

## The Role of Science in Environmental Conservation:
Science is dedicated to the pursuit of truth through empirical evidence. Prior to my fieldwork, my understanding of the vast biodiversity in the oceans was grounded in belief and second-hand knowledge. However, the firsthand observation of microplankton thriving in mere droplets of seawater transformed this abstract knowledge into tangible reality. This personal experience underscores the critical role of science in environmental conservation: it provides incontrovertible evidence. With such empirical proof, we can construct compelling and well-founded arguments advocating for environmental conservation.
